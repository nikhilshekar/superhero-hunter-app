# SuperHero Hunter App

Fetch and display a list of SuperHeros (Characters) on the home page. Also create a search bar that will filter out the character based on search query. Suppose I type “bat” in the search field, it should show “batman”. [ API example https://superheroapi.com/api.php/3328323083897178/ ].On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).Superhero page will show a lot of information about the superhero like their name, image, bio and other information provided by the API (powerstats, appearence, connections, etc).
